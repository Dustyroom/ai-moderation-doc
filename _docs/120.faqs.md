#### Why my prompt is not working (well)?
> You can ask anything you like, but please, keep it clean and appropriate. The more specific you are the better the results will be. ChatGPT will output better results for the simpler but specific prompt. Please, remember that specific doesn't mean short. It will work the best if you describe your request with at least several sentences covering all nuances of your request. It is advised that you use less pronouns like 'it' or 'they' and more nouns like 'the given model' or 'the character'.

#### My generated script is not working (has errors).
> Most likely, you didn't phrase your request in a way ChatGPT artificial intelligence could understand. Please, try to be more specific and detailed. If you are not sure how to phrase your request, please, look at the frequently asked question above.

#### What can I ask in my prompt?
> You can ask ChatGPT Script Generator to build a script for you. In some cases, depending on your request, the resulting scripts will be complemented with additional components (if your prompt contains such a request).
