#### I've got an issue. How can I fix it?
> Please have a look at the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/) page of this documentation. If you can't find a solution to your problem there, please [get in touch](/contact-details/).

#### What can I ask in my prompt?
> You can ask ChatGPT Script Generator to build a C# script for you. In some cases, depending on your request, the resulting scripts will be complemented with calling the additional Unity's components, e.g. when asking to make buttons for a menu, most likely ChatGPT will add the Canvas Component as well. To get a better outcome from the AI generated scripts, please have a look at this page for more details: [How To Write Prompts](/how-to-write-prompts/).

#### What kind of scripts does ChatGPT Script Generator generate?
> ChatGPT Script Generator can generate runtime components (`MonoBehaviours`) so far. Stay tuned for the updates.

#### We are gathering the most asked questions now.
