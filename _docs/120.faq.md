#### I've got an issue. How can I fix it?
> Please have a look at the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/) page of this documentation. If you can't find a solution to your problem there, please [get in touch](/contact-details/).

#### How expensive is it to use {{ site.title_short }}?
> The cost depends on usage, but generally the API is very cheap. Generating 1000 long scripts with the default settings (*gpt-3.5-turbo* with normal context length) costs about $3. Using *extended context* in *gpt-3.5-turbo* increases the cost to $7. Using *gpt-4* is 30x more expensive, ~$90 for 1000 long scripts.
> There's also a free option with the proxy server, although there's occasional times when that is down.
> Using [Google Bard](/bard-set-up/) has similar or lower costs than OpenAI, and it is just as powerful.

#### What can I ask in my prompt?
> You can ask {{ site.title_short }} to build a C# script for you. In some cases, depending on your request, the resulting scripts will be complemented with calling the additional Unity's components, e.g. when asking to make buttons for a menu, most likely ChatGPT will add the Canvas Component as well. To get a better outcome from the AI generated scripts, please have a look at this page for more details: [How To Write Prompts](/how-to-write-prompts/).

#### What kind of scripts does {{ site.title_short }} generate?
> {{ site.title_short }} can generate runtime components (`MonoBehaviours`) so far. Stay tuned for the updates.
