Chroma provides a set of Shader Graph nodes to help you create shaders. These nodes are used to sample gradients and curves.

**Note:** Gradients and curves are only a part of Chroma. For the full list of attributes, see [Shader UI Attributes](/shader-ui-attributes/).

## Overview

Chroma provides the following Shader Graph nodes:
* **Sample Gradient Texture** - allows you to get a value from a gradient.

* **Sample HDR Gradient Texture** - allows you to get a value from an High Dynamic Range gradient (with color brightness greater than 1.0).

* **Sample Curve Texture** - allows you to get a value from a curve.

## Example Shader Graph
Let's look at a simple example using Shader Graph. It uses a gradient to control the color of the object and a curve to control the specular highlight.

Final result of the example shader. The gradient is used to color the object and the curve is used to control the specular highlight (bright yellow spots).

**Note:** The example shader uses the Universal Render Pipeline, but the usage of Chroma is the same for all render pipelines.

## Shader Graph
The shader graph for this shader is shown below. It's a very simple shader graph that uses a gradient to control the color of the object.

The shader graph for the example shader. With just one gradient and one curve we can create a very flexible shader.

Do not forget to set `Chroma` as the `Custom Editor GUI` in the shader's `Graph Settings`. This will allow you to use the Chroma UI.

## Break Down

The first node is a `Sample Gradient` node. This node is used to sample a gradient. The `Gradient` input is the gradient we want to sample. The `Time` input is the time parameter. In this case we are using the dot product of the world space normal and the world space light direction. This means that the gradient is applied to the object based on the angle of the light and the normal of the object. This is a very common technique used to create a very flexible look.

Next is a `Sample Curve` node. This node is used to sample a curve. The `Curve` input is the curve we want to sample. The `Time` input is the time parameter. In this case we are using the dot product of the world space normal and the world space light direction.
