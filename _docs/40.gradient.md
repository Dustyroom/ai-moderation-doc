## Gradient Brief Overview
_Gradient_ is a shader parameter that allows you to create a smooth or stepped transition between two or more colors. It's a great way to add some visual interest to your materials.

_Gradients are useful in almost any shader_. For example, let's say you're creating a terrain shader that changes color depending on the height of the surface. You can use a gradient to smoothly transition between colors as the height changes. You can use the alpha channel of the gradient to control the impact of normals on shading and boom, you have the "Monument Valley" look in your game.

We've also seen gradients used in shaders that control the color of a fire, the color of a water surface, the color of a sky, the color of a fog, and so on. The possibilities are endless. Some of these examples are included in the [Chroma Demos](/demo-scenes/).

### Gradient in Action
Here's a simple example of a gradient in action. The gradient is used to control the color of a sphere. The sphere is lit by a directional light.

## HDR Gradients
Often you need to use gradients in HDR lighting. For example, you might want to create a gradient that controls the color of a fire. In this case, you need to use an HDR gradient. HDR gradients are gradients that use HDR colors. This means that the colors in the gradient can have a value greater than 1.0.

To create an HDR gradient, you need to add a `Gradient(HDR)` property to your shader.

For an example of an HDR Gradient, please load the [LDR-HDR Demo Scene] located in _Assets/Chroma/Demos_.

## Adding a Gradient to a Shader
To create a gradient, you need to add a `Gradient` property to your shader. Here's how to do it depending on whether you're using Shader Graph or a code shader.

The property type of gradient is always a texture (`Texture2D` in Shader Graph and `2D` in code). The texture is a 1D texture that contains the gradient data. The texture is created automatically when you add a gradient property to your shader.

Gradient properties take two parameters:
- `Resolution` - The resolution of the gradient texture. The higher the resolution, the smoother the gradient. The default value is 256. If you're noticing banding (staircase effect) in your gradient, try increasing the resolution to 512 or 1024.
- `HDR` - Whether the gradient is HDR or not. The default value is `false`. HDR means that the gradient can have values greater than 1.0. This is useful if you want to use the gradient to control the intensity of a light, or make parts of an object emissive.

Here are the steps to add a gradient property to your shader.

### Code (ShaderLab, HLSL)

### Shader Graph

## Gradient Inspector

### Gradient Editor
The Gradient Editor is a tool that allows you to create and edit gradients. It's a part of the Gradient parameter in the Inspector.

Clicking on an icon of the _Gradient_ opens the _Gradient Editor_ where you can freely add up to eight individual independent color _breakpoints_ (color stops) and move them across the ramp. The layout of the colors on the _breakpoints_ corresponds to the layout of the colors on the scene object the material is applied to. When you move the _breakpoint_ or change the color values in _Gradient Editor_, the shading changes on the affected object(s) simultaneously, **in real time**. It is extremely useful for fine-tuning the color positions on the object. Also, it works for the models that have no UV maps.

**TIP.** Whenever you make up an interesting gradient in the Gradient Editor, you can save it by pressing the ‘New’ button in the ramp presets section of the Gradient Editor. This adds an icon of the gradient to the collection, which is really useful if you want to quickly preview different possible gradients.

There are ‘smooth’ and ‘fixed’ color gradations in the Gradient editor. You can have a sharp transition from one color to another by selecting a _Fixed_ mode (using 1 color stop). If you select _Smooth_ mode, the transition from color band to the adjacent one will be gradual. See the pictures below.

In _Smooth_ mode you can set all or some of the color stops closely to the adjacent ones to make a stepped (reminiscent of _Fixed_ mode) or partially stepped / partially smooth gradient.

Please, note that if you would like to get a smooth gradient, your model should have smooth normals. Otherwise, even if you have the _Blend_ mode chosen, but you have a model with hard normals, you'll likely see a stepped gradient. If you have no option to edit a model, you can try adjusting the parameters in the model's _Import Settings_

### Randomization
You can create random gradients by using the _Random_ and _Random complimentary_ buttons in a gradient's context menu. The _Random_ button creates a gradient with 4 random colors that go well together. The _Random complimentary_ button creates a gradient with random colors that are complimentary (opposite) to each other.

### [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) Integration
Chroma integrates with Adobe Color, a popular color scheme generator. You can use it to create gradients and then import them into your material.

### [ColorHunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/) Integration
ColorHunt.co is a great resource for finding color palettes. You can easily import a color palette from ColorHunt.co right into Unity shader UI that uses Chroma.

### Presets
**TIP.** Whenever you make up an interesting gradient in the Gradient Editor, you can save it by pressing the ‘New’ button in the ramp presets section of the Gradient Editor. This adds an icon of the gradient to the collection, which is really useful if you want to quickly preview different possible gradients.
