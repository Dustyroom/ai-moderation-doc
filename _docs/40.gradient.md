## Gradient Brief Overview
_Gradient_ is a shader parameter that allows you to create a smooth or stepped transition between two or more colors. It's a great way to add some visual interest to your materials.

**Gradients are useful in almost any shader**. For example, let's say you want to create a terrain shader that changes color depending on the height of the surface. You can use a gradient to smoothly transition between colors as the height changes. You can use the alpha channel of the gradient to control the impact of normals on shading and boom, you have the "Monument Valley" look in your game.

We've also seen gradients used in shaders that control the color of a fire, the color of a water surface, the color of a sky, the color of a fog, and so on. The possibilities are endless. Some of these examples are included in the [Chroma Demos](/demo-scenes/).

## Gradient in Action

Here's a simple example of a gradient in action. The gradient is used to control the color of a sphere. The sphere is lit by a directional light.

## Beginning to work with gradients

To create a gradient, you need to add a `Gradient` property to your shader. Here's how to do it depending on whether you're using Shader Graph or a code shader.

### Code (ShaderLab, HLSL)

### Shader Graph

## Gradient Parameter in the Inspector

### Gradient Editor
The Gradient Editor is a tool that allows you to create and edit gradients. It's a part of the Gradient parameter in the Inspector.

### [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) Integration
Chroma integrates with Adobe Color, a popular color scheme generator. You can use it to create gradients and then import them into your material.

### [ColorHunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/) Integration
ColorHunt.co is a great resource for finding color palettes. You can easily import a color palette from ColorHunt.co right into Unity shader UI that uses Chroma.

## Presets

**TIP.** Whenever you make up an interesting gradient in the Gradient Editor, you can save it by pressing the ‘New’ button in the ramp presets section of the Gradient Editor. This adds an icon of the gradient to the collection, which is really useful if you want to quickly preview different possible gradients.

## HDR Gradients

Often you want to use gradients in HDR lighting. For example, you might want to create a gradient that controls the color of a fire. In this case, you need to use an HDR gradient. HDR gradients are gradients that use HDR colors. This means that the colors in the gradient can have a value greater than 1.0.

To create an HDR gradient, you need to add a `Gradient(HDR)` property to your shader.
