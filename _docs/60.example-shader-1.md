## Gradient Lit Shader
This is a simple lit shader example using Shader Graph. It uses a gradient to control the color of the object.

## Shader Graph
The shader graph for this shader is shown below. It's a very simple shader graph that uses a gradient to control the color of the object.

The time value of the gradient is the dot product of the world space normal and the world space light direction. This means that the gradient is applied to the object based on the angle of the light and the normal of the object. This is a very simple way to apply a gradient to an object. It's not very realistic, but it's a good way to get started with gradients.

## Result
The result of the shader is shown below. The gradient is used to control the color of the object. The object is lit by a directional light.
