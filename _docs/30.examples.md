## Overview

Example shaders are the shaders that are made during the preparation of the [Chroma Demos](/demo-scenes/). We included them so that you can dissect them and learn how to use the features of Chroma. Also, they are already nicely featured and can be used as a starting point for your own shaders or already complete shaders for your projects. 

## Example Prompts

### Example Prompt 1

A simple unlit gradient shader. It uses the Chroma's [`Gradient` node](/gradient/#adding-a-gradient-to-a-shader) to create a gradient. The point at which gradient is sampled is based on object normal and light direction.
