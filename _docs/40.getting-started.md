Once you [set up](/installation/) the {{ site.title_short }}, you can start using it to generate and edit C# scripts for your Unity projects.

## Using the {{ site.title_short }}
After setting up the API key, you can now use the {{ site.title_short }} in the Unity Editor:
1. In the Unity Editor, select a GameObject and click the **“Generate Component”** button in
the Inspector.
1. **Type a ChatGPT prompt** describing the C# script you would like to add.
1. Click **"Generate"**, and the script will be automatically created and added to your project.

## Important Notices
1. ⚠️ Please be aware that the API key is stored in the following file: `UserSettings/ChatGptScriptGeneratorSettings.asset`. When sharing your project with others, be sure to **exclude the "UserSettings" directory** to prevent unauthorized use of your API key.
1. Please be aware that ChatGPT, being an AI model, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output.
1. Unfortunatelly, we can't control how the AI will generate the scripts. Sometimes it may generate scripts that are not working or not what you are looking for. To get a better outcome from the AI generated scripts, please have a look at this page for more details: [How To Write Prompts](https://chatgpt.dustyroom.com/how-to-write-prompts/)

## Generating a Script with ChatGPT Prompt Window
Type your request in the prompt window and click **"Generate and Add"** to start the script generation process. You can also use `Ctrl + Ender` (Windows) or `Cmd + Ender` (Mac). The generated script will be added to your project (by default, in `Assets/Scripts`, but you can choose the destination in the _Output Path_ field in the [General Settings](/getting-started/#general-settings)).

_AI Toolbox_ looks whether the generation is going successfully or it is going to have potential errors. If the script generation went without errors, by default you will have a new script in your project (by default, in `Assets/Scripts`, but you can choose the destination in the _Output Path_ field in the [General Settings](/getting-started/#general-settings)).
If you have the _Auto-accept_ option turned off, you'll be presented with an according window in the end each generation process. To change this option, go to the [General Settings](/getting-started/#general-settings) and check the _Auto-accept new files_ checkbox.

### If Editing the Script Results in Errors

{{ site.title_short }} sees if the code that is being generated will have errors and eventually will fail to compile. {{ site.title_short }} will give a few options to address that. If you have any errors when the script is generated, the look of the script generation window will change to the following:

- **Accept** - This will accept the changes.

## Generating Images with DALL•E

{{ site.title_short }} can generate images using the [DALL•E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) model. To generate an image, you need to have a prompt that contains the text description of the image you want to generate. The prompt can be as simple as "A brick wall texture" or as complex as "A futuristic retro space ship landing on a snow-covered planet". The more complex the prompt, the more detailed the image will be.

To open the DALL•E generation propmt window, right-click anywhere in the Project tab and select **Create** ▶︎ **Texture by DALL•E**.

### Generation Settings

- **Default temperature** controls randomness: higher _Temperature_ results in more random completions. As the _Temperature_ approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive. Lower the _Temperature_ to get more or less the same results when you re-iterate the script generations, for example. Raise the _Temperature_ to get more diverse, creative and surprising results upon each completion. Current default _Temperature_ is 0.

### Guiding Prompts

_Guiding Prompts_ are used to help the model generate scripts that are more relevant to your project.

- **+** and **Trash Bin** buttons add and remove guiding prompts.
- **Checkboxes** enable or disable guiding prompts without deleting them.
- **Reset to default** resets the guiding prompts to the default values.

### General Settings

- **Timeout** - if enabled, the _Duration_ field appears. If ChatGPT doesn't respond within the _Duration_ parameter of the _Timeout_, the script generation fails. Try increasing this value if ChatGPT constantly outputs the 'timeout' error. (If you have this error, please also look at [this paragraph](/troubleshooting/#i-am-getting-a-timeout-issue)) Current default _Duration_ is 60 seconds.
- **Duration** - is the time in seconds that the script generation process will wait for a response from ChatGPT.
- **Output Path** - is the path where the generated scripts will be saved. By default, it is set to `Assets/Scripts`.
- **Inspector button** - if enabled, the _"Generate Component"_ button appears on every Game Object's Inspector panel.
- **Auto-accept new files** - if enabled, the script generation window will be automatically closed after the new script is generated and saved. If disabled, the script generation window will stay open and you will be able to choose a further action with the script.
- **Auto-accept edits** - if enabled, the script generation window will be automatically closed after the edited script is saved. If disabled, the script generation window will stay open and you will be able to choose a further action with the script. More info about these actions can be found [here](/getting-started/#editing-the-script-with-chatgpt-prompt-window).
