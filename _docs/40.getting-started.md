Once you [set up](/installation/) the ChatGPT Script Generator, you can start using it to generate C# scripts for your Unity projects.

## Using the ChatGPT Script Generator
After setting up the API key, you can now use the ChatGPT Script Generator in the Unity Editor:
1. In the Unity Editor, select a GameObject and click the **“Generate Component”** button in
the Inspector.
1. **Type a ChatGPT prompt** describing the C# script you would like to add.
1. Click **"Generate"**, and the script will be automatically created and added to your project.

Press **Generate Component** button to open the prompt box

Alternatively, there is another option to open the prompt box for generating a script. Right-click in the **Project** tab ▶︎ select **Create** ▶︎ click **C# Script by ChatGPT**.

## Important Notices
1. ⚠️ Please be aware that the API key is stored in the following file: `UserSettings/ChatGptScriptGeneratorSettings.asset`. When sharing your project with others, be sure to **exclude the "UserSettings" directory** to prevent unauthorized use of your API key.
1. Please be aware that ChatGPT, being an AI model, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output.
1. Unfortunatelly, we can't control how the AI will generate the scripts. Sometimes it may generate scripts that are not working or not what you are looking for. To get a better outcome from the AI generated scripts, please have a look at this page for more details: [How To Write Prompts](https://chatgpt.dustyroom.com/how-to-write-prompts/)

## ChatGPT Script Generator Prompt Window

Type your request in the prompt window and click **"Generate and Add"** to generate a script. The generated script will be added to your project.

**Advanced Options** — if expanded, reveals the [_Temperature_](/getting-started/#temperature) and [_History_](/getting-started/#prompt-history) parameters, mirrored from the [**Settings panel**](/getting-started/#chatgpt-script-generator-settings) (which can be found in _Edit_ ▶︎ _Project Settings_ ▶︎ _ChatGPT Script Generator_).

## ChatGPT Script Generator Settings

The settings can be found in Edit ▶︎ Project Settings ▶︎ ChatGPT Script Generator.

### OpenAI API Key

- **API Key** is the field where you will need to paste your API Key, once it is generated [(here is more info on API Key generation)](/installation/#api-key-generation).

⚠️ The API key is stored in the following file: `UserSettings/ChatGPTScriptGeneratorSettings.asset`. When sharing your project with others, be sure to **exclude the "UserSettings" directory** to prevent unauthorized use of your API key.

### GPT Model

- **Model** is the GPT model that will be used to generate scripts. The default model is _gpt-3.5-turbo_.
- **OpenAI Documentation** opens the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models){:target="_blank"} in your browser.

### Generation Settings

#### Temperature

- **Temperature** controls randomness: higher _Temperature_ results in more random completions. As the _Temperature_ approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive. Lower the _Temperature_ to get more or less the same results when you re-iterate the script generations, for example. Raise the _Temperature_ to get more diverse results upon each completion.

</a>

#### Guiding Prompts

_Guiding Prompts_ are used to help the model generate scripts that are more relevant to your project.

- **+** and **-** buttons add and remove guiding prompts.
- **Reset to default** resets the guiding prompts to the default values.

### General Settings

- **Output Path** is the path where the generated scripts will be saved. By default, it is set to `Assets/Scripts`.
- **Inspector button** if enabled, the _"Generate Component"_ button appears on every Game Object's Inspector panel.
