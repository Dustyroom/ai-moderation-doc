Once you [set up](/installation/) the ChatGPT Script Generator, you can start using it to generate C# scripts for your Unity projects.

## Using the ChatGPT Script Generator
After setting up the API key, you can now use the ChatGPT Script Generator in the Unity Editor:
1. In the Unity Editor, select a GameObject and click the **“Generate Component”** button in
the Inspector.
1. **Type a ChatGPT prompt** describing the C# script you would like to add.
1. Click **"Generate"**, and the script will be automatically created and added to your project.

Important Notices
1. Please be aware that the API key is stored in the following file: `UserSettings/ChatGptScriptGeneratorSettings.asset`. When sharing your project with others, be sure to **exclude the "UserSettings" directory** to prevent unauthorized use of your API key.
1. Please be aware that ChatGPT, being an AI model, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output.
