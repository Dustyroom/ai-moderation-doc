## Stylized Lit Shader Brief Overview
_Stylized Lit_ shader is a main go-to lit shader to be used in the majority of situations. It is a stylized shader, whose output ranges from a strict one-color flat surface to a cartoon style look, to a vivid acid-color experimental mess, with lots of the sweet spots in between.

## Beginning to work with the Stylized Lit Shader
1. Create a material.
1. In the **Inspector** panel, in the **Shader** drop down menu choose **Chroma** ▶︎ **Stylized Lit**.
Now you can apply this material to a 3D game object on your Scene or in the Hierarchy panel.

## Parameters of the Stylized Lit Shader

### Gradient

This is one of the highlight features of Chroma shaders. Put simply, _Gradient_ (also referred as _Gradient Editor_) lets you dial in up to 8 independent colors per single material. You can make the color bands as wide or narrow as you want. In this manual we keep returning to this über-parameter with different examples.

The same Gradient Editor is available for the following shaders: [Stylized Lit](../stylized-lit-shader), [Foliage](../foliage-shader), [Skybox](../skybox-shader), [Cloud3D](../cloud3d-shader), [Cloud2D](../cloud2d-shader). You can find the detailed explanation of the _Gradient_ in the ['Gradient' sub-chapter of 'Stylized Lit shader' chapter](../stylized-lit-shader/#gradient)  
{: .notice--info}

Clicking on an icon of the _Gradient_ opens the _Gradient Editor_ where you can freely add up to eight individual independent color _breakpoints_ (color stops) and move them across the ramp. The layout of the colors on the _breakpoints_ corresponds to the layout of the colors on the scene object the material is applied to. When you move the _breakpoint_ or change the color values in _Gradient Editor_, the shading changes on the affected object(s) simultaneously, **in real time**. It is extremely useful for fine-tuning the color positions on the object. Also, it works for the models that have no UV maps.

**TIP.** Whenever you make up an interesting gradient in the Gradient Editor, you can save it by pressing the ‘New’ button in the ramp presets section of the Gradient Editor. This adds an icon of the gradient to the collection, which is really useful if you want to quickly preview different possible gradients.

There are ‘smooth’ and ‘fixed’ color gradations in the Gradient editor. You can have a sharp transition from one color to another by selecting a _Fixed_ mode (using 1 color stop). If you select _Smooth_ mode, the transition from color band to the adjacent one will be gradual. See the pictures below.

In _Smooth_ mode you can set all or some of the color stops closely to the adjacent ones to make a stepped (reminiscent of _Fixed_ mode) or partially stepped / partially smooth gradient.

Please, note that if you would like to get a smooth gradient, your model should have smooth normals. Otherwise, even if you have the _Blend_ mode chosen, but you have a model with hard normals, you'll likely see a stepped gradient. If you have no option to edit a model, you can try adjusting the parameters in the model's _Import Settings_
{: .notice--warning}

- **Shading Offset** _Shading Offset_ moves the gradient over the model. It’s a convenience parameter, because this effect can be also made by moving all the stop points in the _Gradient Editor_.
