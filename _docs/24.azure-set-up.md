[*Azure OpenAI Service*](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/openai/){:target="_blank"} is a cloud-based service that provides access to the *ChatGPT* model. It is a great option for developers who want to use *ChatGPT* in their Unity projects. *Azure OpenAI Service* is a paid service, but it offers a free tier that allows you to use the service for free up to a certain limit. The free tier is a great way to try out the service and see if it meets your needs.

Currently, you must submit an application to access *Azure OpenAI Service*. To apply for access, complete [this form](https://aka.ms/oai/access){:target="_blank"}. It generally takes about one business day to receive access after submitting the form.

The set up of ChatGPT API via *Azure* consists of the following steps:

1. Set up an *Azure* resource.
1. Configure access to the *Azure* resource from Unity.

Let's go through these steps in detail.

## Set up an Azure resource

First, you need to *create a resource* and *deploy a model* in *Azure*.
This is a one-time process that takes a few minutes. After that, you can use *ChatGPT* in any {{ site.title_short }} project.
Follow the instructions in this [Azure documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal){:target="_blank"}.

## Configure access to the Azure resource from Unity

Now you need to set up access to the project from your Unity Editor.

1. Get *API key* and *endpoint* from the *Azure* resource you created.
