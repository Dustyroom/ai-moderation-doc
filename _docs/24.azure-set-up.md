Setting up ChatGPT via *Azure OpenAI Service* consists of the following steps:

1. Set up an Azure resource.
1. Configure access to the Azure resource from Unity.

Let's go through these steps in detail.

## Set up Azure resource

First, you need to **create a resource** and **deploy a model** in Azure.
This is a one-time process that takes a few minutes. After that, you can use ChatGPT in any {{ site.title_short }} project.

Follow the instructions in this [Azure documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal){:target="_blank"} to comlete this step.

## Configure access to Azure from Unity

Now you need to set up access to Azure from the Unity Editor.

##### Get *API Key* and *Endpoint* from the Azure resource you created
You can find them in the *Keys and endpoint* page in the [Azure dashboard](https://portal.azure.com/).
