#### I am getting a **Timeout** issue
Unfortunately we can't control how long it takes for the ChatGPT to complete the response, but we've added a [timeout setting](https://chatgpt.dustyroom.com/how-to-use/#timeout). It can be configured in the project settings (Edit ▶︎ Project Settings ▶︎ ChatGPT Script Generator). Sometimes this happens, due to some kind of outage on the server side. If you are getting a timeout error, please, try again later.

#### After importing, ChatGPT Script Generator gives errors
- First, try **restarting Unity**. A simple restart indeed sometimes fixes some strange issues.
- **Re-import ChatGPT Script Generator**.
- Verify if the Unity version meets the [requirements](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/chatgpt-script-generator-250892){:target="_blank"}.
- Make sure that you are not using a Unity **beta** release.
- If nothing helps, please, write to info@dustyroom.com and include the detailed description of the issue.
