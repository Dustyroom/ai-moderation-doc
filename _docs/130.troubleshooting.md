#### I am getting a **Timeout** issue
Unfortunately we can't control how long it takes for the ChatGPT to complete the response, but we've added a [timeout setting](/getting-started/#timeout), increasing it may help you solve this issue. It can be configured in the project settings (Edit ▶︎ Project Settings ▶︎ ChatGPT Script Generator). Sometimes this happens, due to some kind of outage on the server side. If you are getting a timeout error, please, try again later.

#### Why is my prompt not working (well)?
> You can ask anything you like, but please keep it clean and appropriate. The more specific you are the better the results will be. ChatGPT will output better results for the simpler but specific prompt. Please remember that specific doesn't mean short. It will work the best if you describe your request with at least several sentences covering all nuances of your request. It is advised that you use less pronouns like 'it' or 'they' and more nouns like 'the given model' or 'the character'. Please have a look at this page for more details: [How To Write Prompts](/how-to-write-prompts/).

#### My generated script is not working (has errors, can't compile).
> Most likely, you didn't phrase your request in a way ChatGPT artificial intelligence could understand. Please try to be more specific and detailed. If you are not sure how to phrase your request, please look at the frequently asked question above. Please be aware that ChatGPT, being an AI model, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output.

#### After importing, ChatGPT Script Generator gives errors
- First, try **restarting Unity**. A simple restart indeed sometimes fixes some strange issues.
- **Re-import ChatGPT Script Generator**.
- Verify if the Unity version meets the [requirements](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/chatgpt-script-generator-250892){:target="_blank"}.
- Make sure that you are not using a Unity **beta** release.
- If nothing helps, please, write to info@dustyroom.com and include the detailed description of the issue.
