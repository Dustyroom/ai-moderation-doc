#### I am getting a **Timeout** issue
> - Unfortunately we can't control how long it takes for the ChatGPT to complete the response, but we've added a [Timeout setting](/getting-started/#general-settings), increasing it may help you solve this issue. It can be configured in the project settings (Edit ▶︎ Project Settings ▶︎ {{ site.title_short }}). Sometimes this happens, due to some kind of outage on the server side. If you are getting a Timeout error, please try generating the script again later.
> - If you are located in China, it may relate to the issue. Below is an excerpt from the [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-ban-openais-chatgpt-likely-135040587.html){:target="_blank"} article:  
`China ordered local apps and websites to terminate services that allow OpenAI’s ChatGPT service, cooling down the rally in Chinese artificial intelligence stocks.`

#### My prompt is not working (well)
> You can ask anything you like, but keep it clean and appropriate. The more specific you are the better the results will be. ChatGPT will output better results for the simpler but specific prompt. Please remember that specific doesn't mean short. It will work the best if you describe your request with at least several sentences covering all nuances of your request. It is advised that you use less pronouns like 'it' or 'they' and more nouns like 'the given model' or 'the character'. Please have a look at this page for more details: [How To Write Prompts](/how-to-write-prompts/).

#### My generated script is not working (has errors, can't compile)
> Most likely, you didn't phrase your request in a way ChatGPT artificial intelligence could understand. Try to be more specific and detailed. If you are not sure how to phrase your request, please look at the [How To Write Prompts](/how-to-write-prompts) page. Please be aware that ChatGPT, being an AI model, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output. A few things to try:
> - When the script generation is complete and there are any errors, you should see the button **Ask ChatGPT to Fix It** in the bottom of the script generation box. [Read more](/getting-started/#editing-the-script-with-chatgpt-prompt-window)
> - Alternatively, press **Revert and Edit Prompt** in the same script generation box and try to rephrase your request. [Read more](/getting-started/#editing-the-script-with-chatgpt-prompt-window)
> - Try generating the code in the web version of ChatGPT in your browser. If the script is generated correctly there, it means that the issue is related to the Unity integration of {{ site.title_short }}. Please [get in touch](/contact-details/) and include the detailed description of the issue.

#### After importing, {{ site.title_short }} gives errors
> There may be several reasons for this. Please try the following:
> - First, try **restarting Unity**. A simple restart indeed sometimes fixes some strange issues.
> - **Re-import {{ site.title_short }}**.
> - Verify if the Unity version meets the [requirements](https://u3d.as/334o?aid=1101lHzQ){:target="_blank"}.
> - Make sure that you are not using a Unity **beta** release.
> - If nothing helps, please [get it touch](/contact-details/) and include the detailed description of the issue.
