excerpt: "Demo Scenes Included in Chroma"
---

In the scenes we tried to showcase a variety of use cases for the Chroma features: shaders, ramps, gradients etc.

Our demo scenes were made for Universal RP but Chroma components work in _Universal RP_, _HDRP_ and _Built-In RP_, both in _Shader Graph_ and _hand-written shaders_.
{: .notice--warning}

The Demo scenes are in _Linear Color Space_. If you use open Chroma Demo Scenes in _Gamma Color Space_, the scenes will look differently.
{: .notice--warning}

Each of the scenes has its own URP Asset file loaded using a special script on the Camera. This way it is easy to add and modify the scenes without need to add Renderers in the wotherwise global URP Asset file.

The scenes can be found in:
_**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder ▶︎ **Demos** folder_

Path to the Demo Scenes included in Chroma

#### Cave Scene
In this scene you can see an example shader in form of a Fog Portal. It reacts and changes its behavior depending on the camera position There is a light beam made with the same shader in this scene.

#### Character Scene
A scene showing a collection of gradients. In this scene some of the materials use height gradients in combination with regular albedo gradients. Among the parameters you can find a useful Blending Mode menu for even more stylistic choices.

#### Fruit Scene
A scene with gradients taken from palette generator websites.

#### Furniture Scene
A barebone black and white scene with a colorful Color Remap material on top, resulting in a sleek display. The material is set in the Renderer Feature inside the scene's Renderer.

#### Grass Plane Scene
In this scene you can find a simple plane with a single material responsible for a grass effect with all the essential parameters. This scene was designed as a showcase for the Curves.

#### LDR-HDR Scene
This scene shows the HDR quality of the Chroma Gradient. A sphere has a material with a gradient with several color stops. Each of these stops is sequentially turned into HDR, while other ones stay in LDR. This scene utilizes a Bloom override in the _Volume_ camera Component

#### Pixel Scene
A monochrome 2D scene with a _Color Remap_ material applied on top, resulting in a colorful look. You can find the selection of gradient presets in Chroma made for this scene.
