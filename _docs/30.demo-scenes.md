excerpt: "Demo Scenes Included in Chroma"

In the scenes we tried to showcase a variety of use cases for the Chroma features: shaders, ramps, gradients etc.

Our demo scenes were made for Universal RP but Chroma components work in _Universal RP_, _HDRP_ and _Built-In RP_, both in _Shader Graph_ and _hand-written shaders_.
{: .notice--warning}

The Demo scenes are in _Linear Color Space_. If you use open Chroma Demo Scenes in _Gamma Color Space_, the scenes will look differently.

The scenes can be found in:
_**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder ▶︎ **Demos** folder_
