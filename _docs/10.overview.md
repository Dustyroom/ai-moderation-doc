## Brief Overview

Chroma is a custom shader UI for Unity that allows you to create beautiful, high-performance, and highly customizable effects with minimum effort. The most important featue of Chroma is the ability to add *gradients* and *curves* to any shader as parameters - a feature that is not available in the default UI. This allows you to create effects that are much more visually appealing and dynamic than what is possible with the default UI. Moreover, with Chroma you can highly customize any Material Inspector to make it more intuitive and user-friendly by adding things like tooltips, notes, foldouts, and more.

Some of the features of Chroma include:
- **Gradient and Curve parameters** - Add gradients and curves to any shader as parameters. This allows you to create effects that are much more visually appealing and dynamic than what is possible with the default UI.
- **Custom Material Inspector** - Highly customize any Material Inspector to make it more intuitive and user-friendly by adding things like tooltips, notes, foldouts, and more.
- **Works with any Render Pipeline**, including built-in render pipeline, URP, HDRP, and even custom Render Pipelines.
- **Supports both Shader Graph and code (CG, HLSL)**, so you can use Chroma with any shader. Chroma also supports Shader Graph's Sub Graphs. You can even use Chroma with shaders that are not written by you.
- Highly optimized and can be used in production without any performance issues.
- Very easy to use, can be set up in a matter of minutes and is beginner friendly. It's a great tool for artists and programmers who are just starting to make shaders, or have been doing it for years.

Gradients and curves are an irreplaceable tool in making almost any shader, from simple toon to complex volumetric effects. It is a way to parametrize colors and numbers in a flexible way, allowing to achieve a vast space of styles and techniques. Moreover, using gradients and curves separates the shader code from design choices. This allows to create a shader once and then use it in many different ways.

Let's take a sky shader as an example. A traditional approach would be to have a shader with a few parameters, like the color of the sky at the horizon and the zenith, and the color of the sun. This approach is very limiting, as it is hard to achieve a wide variety of looks with just a few parameters. A better approach would be to have a gradient that defines the color of the sky at different heights. This way, you can easily change the look of the sky by changing the gradient. The same goes for the sun color. Instead of having a single color, you can have a gradient that defines the color of the sun at different angles. This way, you can easily change the look of the sun by changing the gradient.

One of the highlight features of Chroma is the [Gradient Editor](stylized-lit-shader/#gradient) found in the shaders. In a nutshell, you can have up to 8 independent colors in a single gradient. The combinations of these color stops define the diversity of the material results. You can have a full rainbow (or any other entire palette). And it is possible to vary the blending steepness of the colors within a single gradient (red to orange is stepped and yellow to green is smooth â€” whatever you can imagine).
## Requirements

  * Unity version **2020.3.0 LTS** or higher.
  * Any Rendering Pipeline is supported: Built-in, URP, HDRP and even custom ones.
    * For the demo scenes, we are using Universal Rendering Pipeline (also known as 'URP'). Please install it from the Package Manager to run the demo scenes.
