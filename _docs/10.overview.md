## Brief Overview
Take your game development process to new heights with ChatGPT Script Generator for Unity. Say goodbye to tedious manual coding and embrace the future of AI-assisted game development today!

<!--ChatGPT Script Generator is a Unity asset that allows you to generate C# scripts using [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/){:target="_blank"} language model.-->

Simply type a prompt describing a C# script you want to create. The more specific and clear your description, the better the chances of receiving an accurate script. ChatGPT will use your prompt to generate the script, leveraging its advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. **Once the script is generated, it will be automatically added to your Unity Project, ready for you to customize and integrate as needed**. This streamlined process allows you to _focus on the creative aspects of your project while reducing the time spent on manual coding_.

We hope you enjoy using the ChatGPT Script Generator for Unity! If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions, please [join our community of developers](https://discord.gg/xqfh46kKfw){:target="_blank"} and reach out to our dedicated support team. Happy coding!

## Important Limitations

This asset works with both free and paid OpenAI accounts, but we recommend checking if you have remaining OpenAI usage quota before buying. To check, please enter a prompt in the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground){:target="_blank"}. If you get an error, you probably have exhausted the free API credit and may need to purchase more in the [OpenAI Billing section](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview){:target="_blank"}.

Please be aware that ChatGPT, being an AI model, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output.
