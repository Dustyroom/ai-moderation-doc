## Brief Overview
Chroma is a custom shader UI for Unity that allows you to add *gradients* and *curves* to any shader as parameters, unlocking shaders that are much more visually appealing and dynamic than what is possible with the default UI. Plus, with Chroma you can create supuer intuitive, user-friendly material editors by adding things like tooltips, notes, foldouts, and more.

Some of the features of Chroma include:
- **Gradient and Curve parameters** allows you to create effects that are much more visually appealing and dynamic than what is possible with the default UI.
- **Custom shader attributes** to customize any Material Inspector to make it more intuitive and user-friendly by adding things like tooltips, notes, foldouts, and more.
- **Works with any Render Pipeline**, including built-in render pipeline, URP, HDRP, and even custom Render Pipelines.
- **Supports both Shader Graph and code (ShaderLab, HLSL)**, so you can use Chroma with any shader. Chroma also supports Shader Graph's Sub Graphs. You can even use Chroma with shaders that are not written by you.
- **HDR Gradients** - Chroma gradients support HDR colors, so you can define parts of the gradient that should emit light.
- **Adobe® Color™ and ColorHunt integration**, so you can easily import colors from these websites into your gradients and extract palettes from any image.
- **Highly optimized** and can be used in production without any performance issues.
- **Very easy to use**, can be set up in a matter of minutes and is beginner friendly. It's a great tool for artists and programmers who are just starting to make shaders, or have been doing it for years.
- **Full source code** is included with the asset, so you can modify it to suit your needs.
- **All demo scenes are included**, so you can see how Chroma works in practice. Everything you see in the videos and on the screenshots is included in the asset.

Gradients and curves are an _irreplaceable tool_ in making almost any shader, from simple lowpoly shading to complex volumetric effects. By default, Unity can only pass numbers, vectors, and textures to shaders, but with Chroma you can pass gradients and curves as well. Here's how they look:
- Gradients allow you to pass a ramp of colors to the shader. You can define the colors and positions of the ramp, and the shader can use the colors at any position along the ramp.
  - TODO: image
  {: .notice--danger}
- Curves (or technically, `AnimationCurve`'s) allow you to draw a 2D curve in the inspector and pass it to the shader:
  - TODO: image
  {: .notice--danger}

Together these two are a must-have in shader programming and technical art, applicable to a vast space of styles and techniques.

Let's take a sky shader as an example. A traditional approach would be to have a shader with a few parameters, like the color of the sky at the horizon and the zenith, and the color of the sun. This approach is very limiting, as it is hard to achieve a wide variety of looks with just a few parameters.

A better approach would be to have a gradient that defines the color of the sky at different heights. This way, you can easily change the look of the sky by changing the gradient. The same goes for the sun color. Instead of having a single color, you can have a gradient that defines the color of the sun at different angles. This way, you can easily change the look of the sun by changing the gradient.

Moreover, you can use gradients to define the color of the clouds, the color of the moon, the color of the stars, and so on. This way, you can easily change the look of the sky by changing the gradients. This is a much more flexible approach than having a lots of individual color parameters.

Here's how the sky shader would look **without Chroma**:

{: .notice--danger}

And here's how the sky shader would look **with Chroma**:
TODO: image
{: .notice--danger}

## How Chroma Works
Under the hood, Chroma uses custom [Material Property Drawers](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MaterialPropertyDrawer.html) to draw the gradients and curves in the inspector, along with a custom context menu, where you can generate nice random gradients, invert them, and so on. Our custom drawer quietly bakes the gradients and curves into textures, and passes them to the shader as textures. The shader then reads the textures and uses them as it sees fit. For things like headers and fodouts, we use a [Custom Shader GUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-CustomShaderGUI.html) to draw them in the inspector.

## What's Included
