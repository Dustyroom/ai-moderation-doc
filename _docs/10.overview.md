With {{ site.title_short }}, you can use the power of AI both in the Unity Editor and in your shipped games. It allows you to generate C# scripts from text descriptions, and generate images from text descriptions, including seamlessly tiling ones, right in your project.

## Using AI in the Unity Editor

**ChatGPT** is a powerful AI model that can generate C# scripts from text descriptions. It can be used to generate scripts for any purpose, including game mechanics, UI, and more. The generated scripts can be used as a starting point for your own scripts, or as a learning tool to understand C# and Unity concepts.

With {{ site.title_short }} you can [generate](/getting-started/#generating-a-script-with-chatgpt-prompt-window) scripts and they will be automatically integrated into your Unity Project. This streamlined process allows you to _focus on the creative aspects of your project while reducing the time spent on manual coding_.

You can also [edit](/getting-started/#editing-the-script-with-chatgpt-prompt-window) any scripts with {{ site.title_short }}, both generated and hand-written.

**DALL•E** is an advanced AI model that can generate images from text descriptions. It can be used to generate textures, UI elements, logos, reference images, and more. {{ site.title_short }} allows you to generate images from text descriptions right in your Unity project.

Using {{ site.title_short }}, you can [generate](/getting-started/#generating-images-with-dalle) images from text descriptions, including seamlessly tiling ones, right in your Unity project.

**New!** We've added experimental support for **Google Bard**. Now for any question or script you can use both ChatGPT and Bard! Check out [Bard Setup Guide](/bard-set-up/) for more details.
