In this chapter the known limitations of working with Chroma are described.

## Limitations
* **[Built-in RP]**: Any version since **Unity 2019 LTS** is supported.
* **[URP]**: Requires version **10.0.0** or later, which corresponds to Unity version **2020.3.0 LTS** or higher.
* **[HDRP]**: Requires version **11.0.0** or later, which corresponds to Unity version **2021.2.0** or higher.
* **Demo scenes** are using **URP**. Please install it from the Package Manager to run the demo scenes.
* **[Shader Graph + Built-in RP + Unity 2020-2021]**. In this combination **Shader Graph** has [limited functionality](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@14.0/manual/Getting-Started.html) due to Unity's constraints. Chroma does fully support code shaders with Built-in RP in all Unity version and it does fully support Built-in RP + Shader Graph combination in Unity 2022 or later.
