In this chapter the known limitations of working with Chroma are described.

## Limitations
* Unity version **2020.3.0 LTS** or higher. The prior Unity versions have not been tested.
* **All Rendering Pipelines are supported**: Built-in, URP, HDRP and even custom ones. However, the following limitations apply:
  * For the **demo scenes**, we are using URP. Please install it from the Package Manager to run the demo scenes.
  * **Shader Graph** has [limited functionality](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@14.0/manual/Getting-Started.html) with the **Built-in Render Pipeline** in **Unity 2020-2021**. Because of this, Chroma does not fully support the Built-in Render Pipeline in Unity 2020-2021. Chroma does fully support code shaders in these versions and it does fully support Built-in RP + Shader Graph combination in Unity 2022 or later.
