## Overview

_Curve_ is a shader parameter that allows you to set a curve in the inspector and sample it in your shader. It's a great way to control lots of different properties with a single property.

Each curve represents a continuous function that maps a value between 0 and 1 to any floating-point value. They are defined by a set of control points. The control points are defined by a time and a value. The time is the position of the control point on the x-axis and the value is the position of the control point on the y-axis. The curve is defined by the control points and the interpolation between them.
