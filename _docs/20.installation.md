*A guide on downloading, importing and setting up Chroma*
{:.image-caption}

First of all, you need to import Chroma into your URP project.  
Please, make sure you have the Universal RP project running, not Built-In RP ('3D', 'Mobile 3D') or HDRP.  
![Create a URP project, not Built-In RP](../assets/images/manual_images/create_new_unity_project_unity_hub_1.png)
 
  * In Unity, go to **Window** ▶︎ **Package Manager**; 
  * On the top left, please, find the **Packages** drop down menu. Select **My Assets** item there. You’ll find **Chroma** among your assets. Choose the version you’d like to import;  
  * Click **Download** (if it is not downloaded yet);  
  * Click **Import**;


## Troubleshooting

Below you can find typical possible issues when installing Chroma as well as other assets in Unity.  

#### Can't import Chroma
- First of all, please, make sure you downloaded Chroma using the _Package Manager_, as shown in the [video](#importing-quibli).
- If the 'Import' button is greyed out, it may be due to the known Package Manager 'cache' issue. Here is how to fix it:  
  1. Please, [locate](#automatic-finalizing) the **Readme** helper tool:  
**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder ▶︎ select **Readme** and go to _Inspector_ panel;  
  1. Press **Clear Cache**;
  1. Download and import Chroma from the _Package Manager_ as shown in the [video](#importing-quibli).

#### After importing, Chroma gives errors
- First, try **restarting Unity**. A simple restart indeed sometimes fixes some strange issues.
- **Re-import Chroma**. Here is how:
  1. Please, locate the **Readme** helper tool:  
**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder ▶︎ select **Readme** and go to _Inspector_ panel;  
  1. Press **Clear Cache**;
  1. Delete the **Chroma** folder from the **Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder;
  1. Download and import Chroma from the _Package Manager_ as shown in the [video](#importing-quibli).
- Verify if the Unity version is equal or is newer than **2020.3.30f1** or **2021.3.5f1**.
- Check if you have a **Universal RP project** open. When creating a new project, it is important to choose **Universal Rendering Pipeline** and _not_ **Built-In aka '3D' or 'Mobile 3D'**.  
![Create a URP project, not Built-In RP](../assets/images/manual_images/create_new_unity_project_unity_hub_1.png)
- Make sure you initially created your project as a URP project, not an 'upgraded from Built-in RP' one.
- Check if you have [finalized the Chroma set-up for URP](../installation/#finalizing-quibli-installation).
- Make sure that you are not using a Unity **beta** release.
- If nothing helps, please, write to info@dustyroom.com and include the screenshot of the Inspector panel of the **Readme** file, which is by default located in **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder.

#### After importing, some of the shaders are missing or cannot be compiled
- Check whether your setup meets the [requirements](../#requirements).
- Try a complete reimport for Chroma. [Here's how](#after-importing-quibli-gives-errors)
